A Minecraft Datapack library for handling items transportation and container declaration, such as for Simpledrawer or EnergyUtils. This library manages the following:
* Entity format for declaring custom containers based on vanilla ones.
* Cable system for transporting items between containers.
* Servo system for extracting and inserting items into containers.
* Custom filters handling for servos and more.
* Function call to output, input and transfer items between containers.

This is an embedded library, so you package it inside your datapack as opposed to having a separate download. Requires [LanternLoad](https://github.com/LanternMC/load) to operate.

# ðŸš§ Known limitations

This section lists the known limitations of ItemIO, what differ from the vanilla game.


## Bad hopper behavior

Hopper next to custom containers are "disable" for minecraft. ItemIO use a custom system to handle the hopper behavior, but it's not perfect.

Hoppers can't pick up items on top of them. If this behavior is implemented, the performance of the datapack will be greatly reduced (like a lot).
